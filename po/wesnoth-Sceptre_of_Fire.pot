"In the northlands, a small dwarvish tribe believes itself to be at peace with the surrounding peoples. However, a few miles south, the King of Wesnoth, Haldric II, marches north with a great stone of power- the ruby of fire. East of this, rebel elves prepare to attack the Wesnothian caravan and steal the ruby. After Rugnur, the young captain of the dwarves, foolishly makes a bargain with the Wesnothians, there is no telling what the consquences will be...\n"
